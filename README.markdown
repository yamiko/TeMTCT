TeMTCT is a simple research study data management application written in Ruby on Rails and is intended as an alternative customised web front end for OpenMRS and an enhanced branch of the Outpatient app from Baobab.

OpenMRSÂ® is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise electronic medical record system framework. We've come together to specifically respond to those actively building and managing health systems in the developing world, where AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria afflict the lives of millions. Our mission is to foster self-sustaining health information technology implementations in these environments through peer mentorship, proactive collaboration, and a code base that equals or surpasses proprietary equivalents. You are welcome to come participate in the community, whether by implementing our software, or contributing your efforts to our mission!
